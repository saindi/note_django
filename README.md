  Getting started

Download the code base on your local machine. You may prefer to use virtual environment to separate the project's dependencies from other packages you have installed.

To install dependencies use pip or poetry:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
poetry install
```
Run migrations:
```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

Create superuser:
```shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Run server:
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
